        This project is a .NET API backend serving a simple HTML/CSS/vanilla JS
        frontend. It collects weather readings from Arduino based sensors at a
        local airport and stores them in a MySQL database, then displays the
        current conditions and wind direction relative to the runway.

        This is the site you're now looking at, an Azure hosted resume along the lines of the Cloud Resume challenge from https://cloudresumechallenge.dev. It uses a static site stored in Azure Blob Storage and served through an Azure CDN for the frontend to a simple HTML/CSS/JS version of my resume. It also uses a C# Azure Function and Azure Table storage to run a visitor counter. All infrastructure for it is managed through Terraform, and the code is built and deployed through Azure Devops Pipelines.
