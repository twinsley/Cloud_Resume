          This project is a simple .NET WPF app intended to help with one of the significant pain points of AAD B2C /
          Entra External ID. It’s common to use extension attributes on users, and the only way to update those
          attributes natively is to use the Graph API. This app provides an easy to use GUI to look up a user by either
          email or UPN and view or update both standard user attributes and the extension attributes.

          This project is a .NET API backend serving a simple HTML/CSS/vanilla JS frontend. It collects weather readings
          from Arduino based sensors at a local airport and stores them in a MySQL database, then displays the current
          conditions and wind direction relative to the runway.
